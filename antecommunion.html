  <P>OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
  come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
  this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
  forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
  But deliver us from evil. Amen.</P>
  
  <P>ALMIGHTY God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known,
  and from whom no secrets are hid; Cleanse the thoughts of our
  hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly
  love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy Name; through Christ
  our Lord. Amen.</P>
  
  <P>Hear what our Lord Jesus Christ saith.<br>
  THOU shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
  all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great
  commandment. And the second is like unto it; Thou shalt love
  thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all
  the Law and the Prophets.<br>    
  <b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee.</b></P>
  
  <P>O ALMIGHTY Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
  to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies,
  in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments;
  that, through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever,
  we may be preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour
  Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>

  <p>Here the Priest may ask the secret intercessions of the
  Congregation for any who have desired the prayers of the Church.</p>
  <P>Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church.<BR />
  ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle hast taught
  us to make prayers, and supplications, and to give thanks for
  all men; We humbly beseech thee most mercifully to accept our
  [alms and] oblations, and to receive these our prayers, which
  we offer unto thy Divine Majesty; beseeching thee to inspire
  continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity,
  and concord: And grant that all those who do confess thy holy
  Name may agree in the truth of thy holy Word, and live in unity
  and godly love.</p>
  <p>We beseech thee also, so to direct
  and dispose the hearts of all Christian Rulers, that they may
  truly and impartially administer justice, to the punishment of
  wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion,
  and virtue.</p>
  <p>Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops and other Ministers,
  that they may, both by their life and doctrine, set forth thy
  true and lively Word, and rightly and duly administer thy holy
  Sacraments.</p>
  <p>And to all thy People give thy heavenly grace; that, with meek heart and
  due reverence, they may hear, and receive thy holy Word; truly
  serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of their
  life.</p>
  <p>And we most humbly beseech thee, of thy goodness, O Lord, to
  comfort and succour all those who, in this transitory life, are
  in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity.</p>
  <p>And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy servants departed
  this life in thy faith and fear; beseeching thee to grant them
  continual growth in thy love and service, and to give us grace
  so to follow their good examples, that with them we may be partakers
  of thy heavenly kingdom. Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's
  sake, our only Mediator and Advocate. Amen.</P>
  
  <P>ALMIGHTY God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,
  Judge of all men; We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins
  and wickedness, Which we, from time to time, most grievously
  have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against thy Divine
  Majesty, Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against
  us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these
  our misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The
  burden of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, Have mercy
  upon us, most merciful Father; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's
  sake, Forgive us all that is past; And grant that we may ever
  hereafter Serve and please thee In newness of life, To the honour
  and glory of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>
  
  <P>Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith unto all
  who truly turn to him.<BR />
  COME unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I
  will refresh you. <i>Matthew 11:28</i><BR />
  So God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, to
  the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life. <i>John 3:16</i></p>
  <p>Hear also what Saint Paul saith.<BR />
  This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,
  That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. <i>1 Timothy 1:15</i></p>
  <p>Hear also what Saint John saith.<BR />
  If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
  the righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our sins. <i>1 John 2:1-2</i></P>
  
  <P>Lift up your hearts.<BR />
  <b>We lift them up unto the Lord.</b><BR />
  Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.<BR />
  <b>It is meet and right so to do.</b></P>
  
  <P>IT is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should
  at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord,
  Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God.</P>

  <p id="preface"></p>
  
  <p>THEREFORE with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company
  of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name; evermore praising
  thee, and saying,</P>
  
  <P>HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, Lord God of hosts, Heaven and earth are full
  of thy glory: Glory be to thee, O Lord Most High. Amen.</P>

  <!--prefaces
  <P>
  xmas octave
  <P>BECAUSE thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be born
  as at this time for us; who, by the operation of the Holy Ghost,
  was made very man, of the substance of the Virgin Mary his mother;
  and that without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin.</P>
  
  epiphany octave
  <P>THROUGH Jesus Christ our Lord; who, in substance of our mortal
  flesh, manifested forth his glory; that he might bring us out
  of darkness into his own glorious light.</P>
  
  candlemas, annunciation, transfiguration
  <P>BECAUSE in the Mystery of the Word made flesh, thou hast caused
  a new light to shine in our hearts, to give the knowledge of
  thy glory in the face of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>
  
  easter octave
  <P>BUT chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious Resurrection
  of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord: for he is the very Paschal
  Lamb, which was offered for us, and hath taken away the sin of
  the world; who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his
  rising to life again hath restored to us everlasting life.</P>
  
  ascension octave
  <P>THROUGH thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who,
  after his most glorious Resurrection, manifestly appeared to
  all his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven,
  to prepare a place for us; that where he is, thither we might
  also ascend, and reign with him in glory.</P>
  
  whitsun week
  <P>THROUGH Jesus Christ our Lord; according to whose most true promise,
  the Holy Ghost came down as at this time from heaven, lighting
  upon the disciples, to teach them, and to lead them into all
  truth; giving them boldness with fervent zeal constantly to preach
  the Gospel unto all nations; whereby we have been brought out
  of darkness and error into the clear light and true knowledge
  of thee, and of thy Son Jesus Christ.</P>
  
  trinity sunday
  <P>WHO, with thine only-begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost, art one
  God, one Lord, in Trinity of Persons and in Unity of Substance.
  For that which we believe of thy glory, O Father, the same we
  believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, without any difference
  of inequality.</P>
  --OR--
  <P>FOR the precious death and merits of thy Son Jesus Christ our
  Lord, and for the sending to us of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter;
  who are one with thee in thy Eternal Godhead.</P>

  all saints octave
  <P>WHO, in the multitude of thy Saints, hast compassed us about
  with so great a cloud of witnesses that we, rejoicing in their
  fellowship, may run with patience the race that is set before
  us, and, together with them, may receive the crown of glory that
  fadeth not away.</P>

  <h2>institution</h2>
  <P>ALL glory be to thee, Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for
  that thou, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son Jesus
  Christ to suffer death upon the Cross for our redemption; who
  made there (by his one oblation of himself once offered) a full,
  perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction,
  for the sins of the whole world; and did institute, and in his
  holy Gospel command us to continue, a perpetual memory of that
  his precious death and sacrifice, until his coming again: For
  in the night in which he was betrayed, he took Bread; and when
  he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his disciples,
  saying, Take, eat, this is my Body, which is given for you; Do
  this in remembrance of me. Likewise, after supper, he took the
  Cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying,
  Drink ye all of this; for this is my Blood of the New Testament,
  which is shed for you, and for many, for the remission of sins;
  Do this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me.
  </P>
  
  <h2>Oblation</h2>
  <P><s>WHEREFORE, O Lord and heavenly Father, according to the institution
  of thy dearly beloved Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, we, thy humble
  servants, do celebrate and make here before thy Divine Majesty,
  with these thy holy gifts, which we now offer unto thee, the
  memorial thy Son hath commanded us to make; having in remembrance
  his blessed passion and precious death, his mighty resurrection
  and glorious ascension; rendering unto thee most hearty thanks
  for the innumerable benefits procured unto us by the same.</s></P>

  <h2>Invocation</h2>
  <P><s>AND we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to hear
  us; and, of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless and sanctify,
  with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts and creatures
  of bread and wine; that we, receiving them according to thy Son
  our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of
  his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed Body
  and Blood.</s></p>
  
  <p>AND we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness, mercifully to
  accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly
  beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits and death of thy
  Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we, and all
  thy whole Church, may obtain remission of our sins, and all other
  benefits of his passion. And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls
  and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living sacrifice unto
  thee; humbly beseeching thee, that we, <s>and all others who shall
  be partakers of this Holy Communion, may worthily receive the
  most precious Body and Blood of thy Son Jesus Christ,</s> be filled
  with thy grace and heavenly benediction, and made one body with
  him, that he may dwell in us, and we in him. And although we
  are unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any
  sacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty
  and service; not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences,
  through Jesus Christ our Lord; by whom, and with whom, in the
  unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O
  Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.</p>

  <p>And now, as our Saviour Christ hath taught us, we are bold to say,<BR />
  OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
  come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
  this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
  forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
  But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
  and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
  
  <!--humble access-->
  <P>WE do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord,
  trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great
  mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs
  under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord, whose property is
  always to have mercy: Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to
  eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his
  blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body,
  and our souls washed through his most precious blood, and that
  we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.</P>
  
  <!--distribution-->
  <P>THE Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee,
  preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Take and eat
  this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on him
  in thy heart by faith, with thanksgiving.</P>
  
  <P>THE Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee,
  preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Drink this
  in remembrance that Christ's Blood was shed for thee, and be
  thankful.</P>

  <!--postcommunion-->
  <P>ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, for
  that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us who have duly received these
  holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious
  Body and Blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost
  assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and
  that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of
  thy Son, which is the blessed company of all faithful people;
  and are also heirs through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by
  the merits of his most precious death and passion. And we humbly
  beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace,
  that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such
  good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus
  Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all
  honour and glory, world without end. Amen.</P>

  <h2>Gloria In Excelsis</h2>
  <P>GLORY be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards
  men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify
  thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God,
  heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.</p>
  <p>O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ; O Lord God, Lamb
  of God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world,
  have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world,
  receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God
  the Father, have mercy upon us.</p>
  <p>For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O
  Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God
  the Father. Amen.</P>
  
  <P>THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your
  hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his
  Son Jesus Christ our Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty,
  the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and
  remain with you always. Amen.</P>
