<h1>Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child</h1>
<h2>After a Birth</h2>
<p><span class='drop-cap'>F</span>ORASMUCH as it hath pleased Almighty God, of his goodness, to give <i>N.</i> safe deliverance, and to preserve her in the great danger of childbirth, and to bless us with the gift of <i>N.</i> our <i>son,</i> let us therefore give hearty thanks unto God, and say:</p>

<h2>After an Adoption</h2>
<p><span class='drop-cap'>F</span>ORASMUCH as it hath
pleased Almighty God,
who hath given us the Spirit
of adoption, that we who
were strangers might
become members of his
household, to bless us with
the gift of <i>N.</i> our
<i>son,</i> let us therefore give
hearty thanks unto God,
and say:</p>
<h2>Ps. 116:1-2, 4-5, 11-13</h2>
<p><span class='drop-cap'>M</span>Y delight is in the Lᴏʀᴅ;
* because he hath heard the voice of my prayer;<br>
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me;
* therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.<br>
I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name
of the Lᴏʀᴅ;
* O Lᴏʀᴅ, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<br>
Gracious is the Lᴏʀᴅ, and righteous;
* yea, our God is merciful.<br>
What reward shall I give unto the Lᴏʀᴅ
* for all the benefits that he hath done unto me?<br>
I will receive the cup of salvation,
* and call upon the Name of the Lᴏʀᴅ.<br>
I will pay my vows unto the Lᴏʀᴅ,
in the sight of all his people,
* in the courts of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s house;
even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lᴏʀᴅ.<i>⸺from Psalm 116</i></p>
<p>GLORY be, &c.</p>

<p>OUR Father, &c.</p>

<h2>Prayer and Thanksgiving after a successful Delivery</h2>
<p>[O Lord, save this woman thy servant;<br>
<b>Who putteth her trust in thee.</b><br>
Be thou to her a strong tower;<br>
<b>From the face of her enemy.</b><br>
Lord, hear our prayer.<br>
<b>And let our cry come unto thee.</b></p>
<p>Let us pray.<br>
O ALMIGHTY God, we give thee humble thanks for
that thou hast been graciously pleased to preserve,
through the great pain and peril of child-birth,
<i>N.</i> thy servant. Grant, we beseech thee, most
merciful Father, that she, through thy help, may
faithfully live according to thy will in this life, and also
may be partaker of everlasting glory in the life to come;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.]</p>

<p><span class='drop-cap'>G</span>RANT, we beseech thee, O heavenly Father, that
<i>N.</i> may daily increase in wisdom and stature, and
grow in thy love and service, until he come to thy eternal
joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>O GOD, who hast taught us through thy blessed Son that
whosoever receives a little child in the Name of Christ
receives Christ himself: We give thee thanks for the
blessing thou hast bestowed upon this family in giving
them this child. Confirm their joy by a lively sense of thy
presence, and give them calm strength and patient wisdom
as they seek to bring this child to love all that is true and
noble, just and pure, lovable and gracious, excellent and
admirable, following the example of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
  
<h2>For a Sibling or Siblings</h2>
<p>[O HEAVENLY Father, whose Son our Savior took
young children into his arms and blessed them:
Strengthen <i>N, &c.</i> to be <i>a</i> wholesome and
godly <i>example, a companion, and an encourager</i> to <i>his</i>
new <i>brother.</i> Preserve them from quarrel and strife, and
through injury give them thy grace readily to forgive;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.]</p>

<h2>For the Birth-parents of an Adopted Child</h2>
<p>[O HEAVENLY Father, we beseech thee to bless the
birth-parents of this child. Reveal the fullness of thy
love, both for them and for the child entrusted to this
family; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.]</p>

<p>The grace, &c.</p>
