This worthless heart of mine.`],
    "E4": [`Eternal Father! strong to save,<br>
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,<br>
Who bid'st the mighty ocean deep<br>
Its own appointed limits keep:<br>
O hear us when we cry to Thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.</p>
<p>O Christ! Whose voice the waters heard<br>
And hushed their raging at Thy word,<br>
Who walkedest on the foaming deep,<br>
And calm amidst its rage didst sleep;<br>
O hear us when we cry to Thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.</p>
<p>Most Holy Spirit! Who didst brood<br>
Upon the chaos dark and rude,<br>
And bid its angry tumult cease,<br>
And give for wild confusion, peace;<br>
O hear us when we cry to Thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.</p>
<p>O Trinity of love and power!<br>
Our brethren shield in danger's hour;<br>
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,<br>
Protect them wheresoe'er they go:<br>
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee<br>
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.`],
    "E5": [`The church of God a kingdom is,<br>
where Christ in power doth reign;<br>
where spirits yearn till, seen in bliss,<br>
their Lord shall come again.</p>
<p>Glad companies of saints possess<br>
this church below, above;<br>
and God’s perpetual calm doth bless<br>
their paradise of love.</p>
<p>An altar stands within the shrine<br>
whereon, once sacrificed,<br>
is set, immaculate, divine,<br>
the Lamb of God, the Christ.</p>
<p>There rich and poor, from countless lands,<br>
praise God on mystic Rood;<br>
there nations reach forth holy hands<br>
to take God’s holy food.</p>
<p>There pure life-giving streams o’erflow<br>
the sower’s garden-ground;<br>
and faith and hope fair blossoms show,<br>
and fruits of love abound.</p>
<p>O King, O Christ, this endless grace<br>
to us and all men bring,<br>
to see the vision of your face<br>
in joy, O Christ, our King.`],
    "E6": [`Great God, what do I see and hear?<br>
The end of things created!<br>
The Judge of all men doth appear,<br>
on clouds of glory seated.<br>
The trumpet sounds, the graves restore,<br>
the dead which they contained before!<br>
Prepare, my soul, to meet him.</p>
<p>
The dead in Christ shall first arise<br>
at that last trumpet's sounding.<br>
caught up to meet him in the skies,<br>
with joy their Lord surrounding.<br>
No gloomy fears their souls dismay,<br>
his presence sheds eternal day<br>
on those prepared to meet him.</p>
<p>
Th'ungodly, filled with guilty fears,<br>
behold his wrath prevailing.<br>
In woe they rise, but all their tears<br>
and sighs are unavailing.<br>
The day of grace is past and gone;<br>
trembling they stand before his throne,<br>
all unprepared to meet him.</p>
<p>
Great God, to thee my spirit clings,<br>
thy boundless love declaring.<br>
One wondrous sight my comfort brings,<br>
the Judge my nature wearing.<br>
Beneath his cross I view the day<br>
when heaven and earth shall pass away,<br>
and thus prepare to meet him.`]
