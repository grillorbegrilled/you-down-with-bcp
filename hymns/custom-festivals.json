            whose wisdom, love, and power<br>
            first bound two lives together<br>
            in Eden’s primal hour,<br>
            today to us thy children<br>
            thine earliest gifts renew,<br>
            a home by thee made happy,<br>
            a love by thee kept true.</p>
        <p>O Savior, Guest most bounteous<br>
            of old in Galilee,<br>
            vouchsafe today thy presence<br>
            with us who call on thee;<br>
            our store of earthly gladness<br>
            transform to heav’nly wine,<br>
            and teach us, in the tasting,<br>
            to know the gift is thine.</p>
        <p>O Spirit of the Father,<br>
            breathe on us from above,<br>
            so mighty in thy pureness,<br>
            so tender in thy love;<br>

            our lives may own thy guidance,<br>
            our hearts be ruled by thee.</p>

            the house is built in vain;<br>
            except thou, Savior, bless it,<br>
            the joy will turn to pain;<br>
            but naught can break the union<br>
            of hearts in thee made one;<br>
            and love thy Spirit hallows<br>
            is endless love begun.`],

The strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
By invocation of the same,<br>
The Three in One and One in Three.</p>
        <p>I bind this day to me for ever,<br>
By power of faith, Christ's Incarnation;<br>
His baptism in Jordan river;<br>
His death on cross for my salvation;<br>
His bursting from the spicèd tomb;<br>
His riding up the heavenly way;<br>
His coming at the day of doom:<br>
I bind unto myself today.</p>
        <p>I bind unto myself the pow'r<br>
Of the great love of cherubim;<br>
The sweet 'Well done' in judgment hour;<br>
The service of the seraphim;<br>
Confessors' faith, apostles' word,<br>
The patriarchs' prayers, the prophets' scrolls;<br>
All good deeds done unto the Lord,<br>
And purity of virgin souls.</p>
        <p>I bind unto myself today<br>
The virtues of the star-lit heav'n,<br>
The glorious sun's life-giving ray,<br>
The whiteness of the moon at even,<br>
The flashing of the lightning free,<br>
The whirling wind's tempestuous shocks,<br>
The stable earth, the deep salt sea,<br>
Around the old eternal rocks.</p>
        <p>I bind unto myself today<br>
The power of God to hold and lead,<br>
His eye to watch, his might to stay,<br>
His ear to hearken to my need;<br>
The wisdom of my God to teach,<br>
His hand to guide, his shield to ward;<br>
The word of God to give me speech,<br>
His heavenly host to be my guard.</p>
        <p><i>Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br>
Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br>
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br>
Christ to comfort and restore me,<br>
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br>
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br>
Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br>
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.</i></p>

Eternal Father, Spirit, Word:<br>
Praise to the Lord of my salvation,<br>
Salvation is of Christ the Lord.`],

the herald of the Word, is born;<br>

        <p>With heav’nly message Gabriel came,<br>

his actions great and manifold.</p>
        <p>John, still unborn, yet gave aright<br>
his witness to the coming light;<br>

fulfilled that witness at his birth.</p>

    "Peter": [`Forsaken once, and thrice denied,<br>
the risen Lord gave pardon free,<br>
stood once again at Peter’s side,<br>
and asked him, “Lov’st thou me?”</p>
        <p>How many times with faithless word<br>
have we denied his holy name,<br>
how oft forsaken our dear Lord,<br>
and shrunk when trial came!</p>
        <p>Saint Peter, when the cock crew clear,<br>
went out, and wept his broken faith:<br>
strong as a rock through strife and fear,<br>
he served his Lord till death.
</p>
        <p>How oft his cowardice of heart<br>
we have without his love sincere,<br>
the sin without the sorrow's smart,<br>
the shame without the tear!</p>
        <p>O oft forsaken, oft denied,<br>
forgive our shame, wash out our sin; <br>
look on us from thy Father's side <br>
and let that sweet look win.</p>
        <p>Hear when we call thee from the deep, <br>
still walk beside us on the shore,<br>
give hands to work, and eyes to weep,<br>
and hearts to love thee more.`]
