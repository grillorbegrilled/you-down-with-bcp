  "ThanksgivingDay": ["O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.<br>The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, * and gather together the outcasts of Israel.<br>He healeth those that are broken in heart, * and giveth medicine to heal their sickness.<br>O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; * sing praises upon the harp unto our God:<br>Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;<br>Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.<br>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; * praise thy God, O Sion.<br>For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, * and hath blessed thy children within thee.<br>He maketh peace in thy borders, * and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen."]
