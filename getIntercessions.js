    <p>OUR Father.</p>
    <p>ALMIGHTY God, whose kingdom is everlasting and power infinite; Have mercy upon this whole land; and so rule the hearts of thy servants <span name="prez"></span> our President, the Governor of this State, and all others in authority, that they, knowing whose ministers they are, may above all things seek thy honour and glory; and that we and all the People, duly considering whose authority they bear, may faithfully and obediently honour them, according to thy blessed Word and ordinance; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth ever, one God, world without end. Amen.</p>
    <p>ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift; Send down upon our Bishops, and other Clergy, especially <span name="primates"></span>, and upon the Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honour of our Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
    <p>BLESS thy servant <i>N.</i> with health of body and of spirit. Let the hand of thy blessing be upon her head night and day, and support her in all necessities, strengthen her in all temptations, comfort her in all sorrows, and let her be thy servant in all changes; and make us both to dwell with thee for ever in thy favour, in the light of thy countenance, and in thy glory. Amen.<i>⸺Jeremy Taylor</i></p>
    <p>ALMIGHTY God, heavenly Father, who hast blessed us with the joy and care of children; Give us light and strength so to train them, that they may love whatsoever things are true and pure and lovely and of good report, following the example of their Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
    <p>O GOD, Giver of life, hear our prayer for <I>N.</i> and for the child she hath conceived, that, by thy grace, they both may come in safety to a timely and healthy birth, and rejoice in thy gracious providence, through Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. Amen.</p>
    <p>GRANT us, O Lord, a vision of this city, fair as it might be in fulfillment of Thy purpose: a city of justice, where none shall prey upon others; a city of plenty, where greed and poverty shall be done away; a city of brotherhood, where success is founded upon service, and honour is given to nobleness alone; a city of peace, where order shall not rest on force, but on love of all for all; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<i>⸺after Walter Rausenbusch</i></p>
    <p><i>Pray for any special intentions.</i></p>
    <p>ASSIST us mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplications and prayers, and dispose the way of thy servants towards the attainment of everlasting salvation; that, among all the changes and chances of this mortal life, they may ever be defended by thy most gracious and ready help; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
