You offered yourself to your persecutors and received the traitor’s kiss. You healed by a miracle the ear of a spiteful enemy, and reproved your zealous servant in his behalf, and went like a lamb to the slaughter, without noise or violence or resistance, when you could have commanded millions of angels for your guard and rescue.</p>

You were accused before the high priest and railed against, and examined with evil purposes and designs of blood; and declared guilty of death for speaking a most necessary truth.</p>

        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, who were nailed upon the cross, and the cross, being set into a hole in the ground, did in the fall rend the wounds wider, and there, naked and bleeding, sick and faint, wounded and despised, didst hang upon the weight of the nails three long hours, praying for the forgiveness of your persecutors.</p>

        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, and blessed be your love, for, even in your agony, you did not ignore the faith of the penitent thief, a faith that all the ages of the Church could never match: for when he saw you condemned to the same fate as himself—crucified, accused, scorned, forsaken, dying, and distressed, with no miracles to prove your divinity or innocence—yet he confessed you a Lord, a King, and his Savior. He confessed his own shame and unworthiness, submitting to the death of the cross, and begging only for your remembrance, for he knew his own sins to be so great, he dared not ask for more. And you, holding the keys of Paradise in your hand, blessed the good thief with the promise to let him in.</p>

        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        <h2>XII. Jesus speaks to his mother and the Beloved Disciple</h2>
        <p>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you,<br>
        <b>For by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.</b></p>
        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, and blessed be your holy Virgin Mother, upon whom old Simeon’s prophecy was now coming to pass. She now truly felt that sword passing through her very soul, and yet she stood by your side, without fleeing, without clamor or pity for herself, but silent in her grief, deep as the waters of the abyss, but smooth as the face of a pool, full of love, and patience, and sorrow, and hope. Now was her time to make use of all your excellent teachings, which you had given to build up her spirit and fortify it against this day, to exercise the strength of faith, to pass from the grief of the Passion to the hope of the Resurrection.</p>
        <p>Crucified Lord Jesus,<br>
        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        <h2>XIII. Jesus dies on the cross</h2>
        <p>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you,<br>
        <b>For by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.</b></p>
        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, who, when the fullness of your suffering was accomplished, gave your soul into the hands of God, reconciling us, who for our sins have no right or claim before the Father.</p>
        <p>Crucified Lord Jesus,<br>
        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        <h2>XIV. Jesus is placed in the tomb</h2>
        <p>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you,<br>
        <b>For by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.</b></p>
        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, for as your body was composed to burial, and dwelt in darkness three days and three nights, your soul descended to the place of the righteous dead, who waited long in expectation of this day, to loose the bonds of their imprisonment and deliver them with yourself into the presence of God.</p>
        <p>Crucified Lord Jesus,<br>
        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore.
        <b>Amen.</b>`;

<h2>Psalm 6</h2>
<p class="dropcap">O Lᴏʀᴅ, rebuke me not in thine indignation, * neither chasten me in thy displeasure.<br>
2 Have mercy upon me, O Lᴏʀᴅ, for I am weak; * O Lᴏʀᴅ, heal me, for my bones are vexed.<br>
3 My soul also is sore troubled: * but, Lᴏʀᴅ, how long wilt thou punish me?<br>
4 Turn thee, O Lᴏʀᴅ, and deliver my soul; * O save me, for thy mercy’s sake.<br>
5 For in death no man remembereth thee; * and who will give thee thanks in the pit?<br>
6 I am weary of my groaning; * every night wash I my bed, and water my couch with my tears.<br>
7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, * and worn away because of all mine enemies.<br>
8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; * for the Lᴏʀᴅ hath heard the voice of my weeping.<br>
9 The Lᴏʀᴅ hath heard my petition; * the Lᴏʀᴅ will receive my prayer.<br>
10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; * they shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.</p>

<h2>Psalm 32</h2>
<p class="dropcap">BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, * and whose sin is covered.<br>
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lᴏʀᴅ imputeth no sin, * and in whose spirit there is no guile.<br>
3 For whilst I held my tongue, * my bones consumed away through my daily complaining.<br>
4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, * and my moisture was like the drought in summer.<br>
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; * and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.<br>
6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lᴏʀᴅ; * and so thou forgavest the wickedness of my sin.<br>
7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when thou mayest be found; * surely the great water-floods shall not come nigh him.<br>
8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; * thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.<br>
9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go; * and I will guide thee with mine eye.<br>
10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; * whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not obey thee.<br>
11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; * but whoso putteth his trust in the Lᴏʀᴅ, mercy embraceth him on every side.<br>
12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lᴏʀᴅ; * and be joyful, all ye that are true of heart.</p>

<h2>Psalm 38</h2>
<p class="dropcap">PUT ME not to rebuke, O Lᴏʀᴅ, in thine anger; * neither chasten me in thy heavy displeasure:<br>
2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, * and thy hand presseth me sore.<br>
3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure; * neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.<br>
4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, * and are like a sore burden, too heavy for me to bear.<br>
5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, * through my foolishness.<br>
6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, * that I go mourning all the day long.<br>
7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, * and there is no whole part in my body.<br>
8 I am feeble and sore smitten; * I have roared for the very disquietness of my heart.<br>
9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; * and my groaning is not hid from thee.<br>
10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, * and the light of mine eyes is gone from me.<br>
11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble, * and my kinsmen stood afar off.<br>
12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; * and they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.<br>
13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; * and as one that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.<br>
14 I became even as a man that heareth not, * and in whose mouth are no reproofs.<br>
15 For in thee, O Lᴏʀᴅ, have I put my trust; * thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my God.<br>
16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph over me; * for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against me.<br>
17 And I truly am set in the plague, * and my heaviness is ever in my sight.<br>
18 For I will confess my wickedness, * and be sorry for my sin.<br>
19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; * and they that hate me wrongfully are many in number.<br>
20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; * because I follow the thing that good is.<br>
21 Forsake me not, O Lᴏʀᴅ my God; * be not thou far from me.</p>

<h2>Psalm 51</h2>
<p class="dropcap">HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; * according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<br>
2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br>
3 For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.<br>
4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight; * that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou shalt judge.<br>
5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother conceived me.<br>
6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.<br>
7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.<br>
9 Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my misdeeds.<br>
10 Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within me.<br>
11 Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy Spirit from me.<br>
12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me with thy free Spirit.<br>
13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, * and sinners shall be converted unto thee.<br>
14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health; * and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.<br>
15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, * and my mouth shall show thy praise.<br>
16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; * but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.<br>
17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: * a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.<br>
18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; * build thou the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations; * then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar.</p>

<h2>Psalm 102</h2>
<p class="dropcap">HEAR my prayer, O Lᴏʀᴅ, * and let my crying come unto thee.<br>
2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; * incline thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.<br>
3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, * and my bones are burnt up as it were a firebrand.<br>
4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; * so that I forget to eat my bread.<br>
5 For the voice of my groaning, * my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.<br>
6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, * and like an owl that is in the desert.<br>
7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, * that sitteth alone upon the housetop.<br>
8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; * and they that are mad upon me are sworn together against me.<br>
9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, * and mingled my drink with weeping;<br>
10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; * for thou hast taken me up, and cast me down.<br>
11 My days are gone like a shadow, * and I am withered like grass.<br>
12 But thou, O Lᴏʀᴅ, shalt endure for ever, * and thy remembrance throughout all generations.<br>
13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; * for it is time that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.<br>
14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, * and it pitieth them to see her in the dust.<br>
15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O Lᴏʀᴅ; * and all the kings of the earth thy majesty;<br>
16 When the Lᴏʀᴅ shall build up Sion, * and when his glory shall appear;<br>
17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, * and despiseth not their desire.<br>
18 This shall be written for those that come after, * and the people which shall be born shall praise the Lᴏʀᴅ.<br>
19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; * out of the heaven did the Lᴏʀᴅ behold the earth;<br>
20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity, * and deliver them that are appointed unto death;<br>
21 That they may declare the Name of the Lᴏʀᴅ in Sion, * and his worship at Jerusalem;<br>
22 When the peoples are gathered together, * and the kingdoms also, to serve the Lᴏʀᴅ.<br>
23 He brought down my strength in my journey, * and shortened my days.<br>
24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age; * as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.<br>
25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, * and the heavens are the work of thy hands.<br>
26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: * they all shall wax old as doth a garment;<br>
27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed; * but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<br>
28 The children of thy servants shall continue, * and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight.</p>

<h2>Psalm 130</h2>
<p class="dropcap">OUT OF the deep have I called unto thee, O Lᴏʀᴅ; * Lord, hear my voice.<br>
2 O let thine ears consider well * the voice of my complaint.<br>
3 If thou, Lᴏʀᴅ, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, * O Lord, who may abide it?<br>
4 For there is mercy with thee; * therefore shalt thou be feared.<br>
5 I look for the Lᴏʀᴅ; my soul doth wait for him; * in his word is my trust.<br>
6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; * I say, before the morning watch.<br>
7 O Israel, trust in the Lᴏʀᴅ; for with the Lᴏʀᴅ there is mercy, * and with him is plenteous redemption.<br>
8 And he shall redeem Israel * from all his sins.</p>

<h2>Psalm 143</h2>
<p class="dropcap">HEAR my prayer, O Lᴏʀᴅ, and consider my desire; * hearken unto me for thy truth and righteousness’ sake.<br>
2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; * for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.<br>
3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; * he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long dead.<br>
4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, * and my heart within me is desolate.<br>
5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works; * yea, I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.<br>
6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; * my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.<br>
7 Hear me, O Lᴏʀᴅ, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint: * hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.<br>
8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for in thee is my trust: * show thou me the way that I should walk in; for I lift up my soul unto thee.<br>
9 Deliver me, O Lᴏʀᴅ, from mine enemies; * for I flee unto thee to hide me.<br>
10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my God: * let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.<br>
11 Quicken me, O Lᴏʀᴅ, for thy Name’s sake; * and for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.<br>
12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, * and destroy all them that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.</p>`;
