You offered yourself to your persecutors and received the traitor’s kiss. You healed by a miracle the ear of a spiteful enemy, and reproved your zealous servant in his behalf, and went like a lamb to the slaughter, without noise or violence or resistance, when you could have commanded millions of angels for your guard and rescue.</p>

You were accused before the high priest and railed against, and examined with evil purposes and designs of blood; and declared guilty of death for speaking a most necessary truth.</p>

        <p>Blessed be your name, O holy Jesus, and blessed be your humility, for when the load of the cross was too great for you to bear because of your wounds, you were content to receive aid from Simon, teaching by his example that we must take up our own crosses and follow you.</p>

        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, and blessed be your love, for, even in your agony, you did not ignore the faith of the penitent thief, a faith that all the ages of the Church could never match: for when he saw you condemned to the same fate as himself—crucified, accused, scorned, forsaken, dying, and distressed, with no miracles to prove your divinity or innocence—yet he confessed you a Lord, a King, and his Savior. He confessed his own shame and unworthiness, submitting to the death of the cross, and begging only for your remembrance, for he knew his own sins to be so great, he dared not ask for more. And you, holding the keys of Paradise in your hand, blessed the good thief with the promise to let him in.</p>

        <h2>XII. Jesus speaks to his mother and the Beloved Disciple</h2>
        <p>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you,<br>
        <b>For by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.</b></p>
        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, and blessed be your holy Virgin Mother, upon whom old Simeon’s prophecy was now coming to pass. She now truly felt that sword passing through her very soul, and yet she stood by your side, without fleeing, without clamor or pity for herself, but silent in her grief, deep as the waters of the abyss, but smooth as the face of a pool, full of love, and patience, and sorrow, and hope. Now was her time to make use of all your excellent teachings, which you had given to build up her spirit and fortify it against this day, to exercise the strength of faith, to pass from the grief of the Passion to the hope of the Resurrection.</p>
        <p>Crucified Lord Jesus,<br>
        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        <h2>XIII. Jesus dies on the cross</h2>
        <p>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you,<br>
        <b>For by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.</b></p>
        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, who, when the fullness of your suffering was accomplished, gave your soul into the hands of God, reconciling us, who for our sins have no right or claim before the Father.</p>
        <p>Crucified Lord Jesus,<br>
        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        <h2>XIV. Jesus is placed in the tomb</h2>
        <p>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you,<br>
        <b>For by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.</b></p>
        <p>Blessed be your name, O Jesus, for as your body was composed to burial, and dwelt in darkness three days and three nights, your soul descended to the place of the righteous dead, who waited long in expectation of this day, to loose the bonds of their imprisonment and deliver them with yourself into the presence of God.</p>
        <p>Crucified Lord Jesus,<br>
        <b>Have mercy on us.</b></p>
        
        The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore.
        <b>Amen.</b>`;
