    <H2>The Seven Deadly Sins</H2>
      <H3>Pride</H3> <!--lion-->
        <p>Vainglory, or a high opinion of one’s achievements. ❦ Indignation at perceived injustices. ❦ Hypocrisy. ❦ Presumption and meddling. ❦ Disobedience. ❦ Loquacity. ❦ Blasphemy. ❦ Impatience. ❦ Stubbornness.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Pride can spring from countless sources, as wealth and prosperity, high descent, fine clothes, wit, beauty, strength, even extraordinary piety and pure morals.</i></p>
      <H3>Envy</H3><!--snake-->
      <p>Ingratitude. ❦ Hatred. ❦ Grieving at the good of another.  ❦ Enjoying or dismissing the misfortune of another. ❦ Exposing faults. ❦ Backbiting. ❦ Upbraiding.</p>
      <H3>Wrath</H3> <!--unicorn-->
        <p>Contention or strife. ❦ Rage. ❦ Abusive reproach. ❦ Cursing.  ❦ Violence.  ❦ Wishing evil upon another.</p>
      <h3>Sloth</h3> <!--bear-->
        <p>A lukewarm heart, which does not light up with love for God. ❦ Faintheartedness or reluctance to undertake anything arduous in the hope of help from God, and in confidence of His grace. ❦ Sluggishness and dullness of heart in doing good. ❦ Idleness.  ❦ Grudging and grumbling.  ❦ Sorrow for loss or displeasure. ❦ Negligence, whether in saying, doing, providing, or caring for anything. ❦ Despair.</p>
      <h3>Greed</h3> <!--fox-->
        <p>Treachery and guile. ❦ Theft. ❦ Rapine, or taking things by violence. ❦ Extortion, or taking things by force or threat. ❦ Perjury, or false testimony. ❦ Simony, or taking payment for religious service. ❦ Usury, or charging interest. ❦ Unwillingness to give or lend. ❦ Murder.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>All that man or woman desires more than is sufficient for leading life comfortably, according to their station, is covetousness, and the root of mortal sin. This is true religion – that every one, according to his station, should borrow from this frail world as little as possible of food, clothes, goods, and of all worldly things.</i></p>
      <h3>Gluttony</h3> <!--swine-->
        <p>Eating too early. ❦ Eating too luxuriously, and being picky. ❦ Eating too voraciously. ❦ Eating too much. ❦ Eating too often.</p>
      <h3>Lust</h3> <!--Scorpion-->
        <p>Most fruits and consequences of this sin are obvious, and so need not be listed in detail. These less-obvious ones, however, must also be considered:</p>
        <p>Lecherous thoughts. ❦ Precursors such as flirting, indecency, and immodesty.</p>

    <H2>The Five Senses</H2>
    <h3>Sight</h3>

      <li>Have I given anyone occasion to do the same?</li>
      <li>Have I desired that any would?</li>
      <li>Have I looked with greed at anything; or innocently, but at the expense of better things, especially my duties?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hearing</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth.</i>&mdash;Ps. 140:11</p>
    <ul>

          <li>That which concerns lechery and other uncleanness?</li> 
          <li>Heresies, lies, backbiting, flattery, or that which instigates men to evil deeds?</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Smell</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Have I followed any pleasing aroma to gluttony, luxury, or any other sinful thought or deed?</li>

    </ul>

    <H2>The Ten Commandments</H2>
    <P><span class='drop-cap'>G</span>OD spake these words, and said:</P>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>I am the Lord thy God; Thou shalt have none other gods but me.</li>
      <li>Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness
      of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath,
      or in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down to them,
      nor worship them,<br>
      <span style="font-size: 75%;">for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins
      of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation
      of them that hate me; and show mercy unto thousands in them that
      love me and keep my commandments.</span></li>
        <!--<b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b><br>-->
      <li>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,<br>
      <span style="font-size: 75%;">for the LORD will not hold him guiltless, that taketh his Name in vain.</span></li>
        <!--<b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b><br>-->
      <li>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day.<br>
      <span style="font-size: 75%;">Six days shalt thou labour, and do all that thou hast to
      do; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God. In
      it thou shalt do no manner of work; thou, and thy son, and thy
      daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy cattle,
      and the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the
      LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,
      and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the seventh
      day, and hallowed it.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b></p>
    <ol type="I" start="5">
      <li>Honour thy father and thy mother.<br>
      <span style="font-size: 75%;">that thy days may be long in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</span></li>
        <!--<b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b><br>-->
      <li>Thou shalt do no murder.</li>
        <!--<b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b><br>-->
      <li>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</li>
        <!--<b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b><br>-->
      <li>Thou shalt not steal.</li>
        <!--<b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</b><br>-->
      <li>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</li>

      <li>Thou shalt not covet<br>
      <span style="font-size: 75%;">thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s
      wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.</span></li>

    <p><b>Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee.</b></P>

    <h2>Confession</h2>
    <p><span class='drop-cap'>A</span>LMIGHTY God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<BR>
    Maker of all things, judge of all men;<BR>
    We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness,<BR>
    Which we, from time to time, most grievously have committed,<BR>
    By thought, word, and deed,<BR>
    Against thy Divine Majesty,<BR>
    Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us.<BR>
    We do earnestly repent, <BR>
    And are heartily sorry for these our misdoings; <BR>
    The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; <BR>
    The burden of them is intolerable. <BR>
    Have mercy upon us, <BR>
    Have mercy upon us, most merciful Father; <BR>
    For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, <BR>
    Forgive us all that is past; <BR>
    And grant that we may ever hereafter <BR>
    Serve and please thee <BR>
    In newness of life, <BR>
    To the honour and glory of thy Name; <BR>
    Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

      Come unto me all that travail and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. <i>&mdash;St. Matthew 11:28</i><br>

      This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. <i>&mdash;1 St. Timothy 1:15</i></p>

    <p>Hear also what Saint John saith.<br>
      If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins. <i>&mdash;1 St. John 2:1</i></p>

    <p><span class='drop-cap'>B</span>LESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven * and whose sin is covered.<BR>
    Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin * and in whose spirit there is no guile.<BR>
    I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord * and so thou forgavest the wickedness of my sin.</p>
    <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.</p>
