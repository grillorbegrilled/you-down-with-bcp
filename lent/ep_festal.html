    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>
    <i>And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.</i><br>
    O God, make speed to save us.<br>
    <i>O Lord, make haste to help us.</i><br>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    <i>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</i><br>
    Praise ye the Lord.<br>
    <i>The Lord's Name be praised.</i></p>
    
    <p>GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us : and shew us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us;<br>
   That thy way may be known upon earth : thy saving health among all nations.<br>
   Let the peoples praise thee, O God : yea, let all the peoples praise thee.<br>
   O let the nations rejoice and be glad : for thou shalt judge the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.<br>
   Let the people praise thee, O God : yea, let all the people praise thee.<br>
   Then shall the earth bring forth her increase : and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.<br>
   God shall bless us : and all the ends of the world shall fear him.</p>
    
    <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.</p>

    <p>O LORD, show thy mercy upon us.<br>
 	  <i>And grant us thy salvation.</i><br>
 	  O Lord, save the State.<br>
 	  <i>And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.</i><br>
 	  Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.<br>
 	  <i>And make thy chosen people joyful.</i><br>
 	  O Lord, save thy people.<br>
 	  <i>And bless thine inheritance.</i><br>
 	  Give peace in our time, O Lord.<br>
 	  <i>For it is thou, Lord, only, that makest us dwell in safety.</i><br>
 	  O God, make clean our hearts within us.<br>
   	<i>And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.</i></p>

    <p>O GOD, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give; that both our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.</p>

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
