    <h1>Morning Prayer</h1>
    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>
    <i>And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.</i><br>
    O God, make speed to save us.<br>
    <i>O Lord, make haste to help us.</i><br>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    <i>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</i><br>
    Praise ye the Lord.<br>
    <i>The Lord's Name be praised.</i></p>
    
    <p>CHRIST our passover is sacrificed for us : therefore let us keep the feast;<br>
      Not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness : but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <i>1 Cor. 5:7, 8</i></p>
    <p>Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more : death hath no more dominion over him.<br>
      For in that he died, he died unto sin once : but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<br>
      Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin : but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Rom. 6:9-11</i></p>
    <p>Christ is risen from the dead : and become the first-fruits of them that slept.<br>
      For since by man came death : by man came also the resurrection of the dead.<br>
      For as in Adam all die : even so in Christ shall all be made alive. <i>1 Cor. 15:20-22</i></p>
    <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
      As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.</p>

    <p>I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth : <br>
    And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br>
    I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholick Church; The Communion of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body, And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p>
    
    <p>O LORD, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by thy governance, to do always that is righteous in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
