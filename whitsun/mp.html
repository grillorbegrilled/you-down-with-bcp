    <h1>Morning Prayer</h1>
    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>
    <i>And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.</i><br>
    O God, make speed to save us.<br>
    <i>O Lord, make haste to help us.</i><br>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    <i>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</i><br>
    Praise ye the Lord.<br>
    <i>The Lord's Name be praised.</i></p>
    
    <p>WE praise thee, O God : we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.<br>
    All the earth doth worship thee : the Father everlasting.<br>
    To thee all Angels cry aloud : the Heavens, and all the Powers therein.<br>
    To thee Cherubin and Seraphin : continually do cry,<br>
    Holy, Holy, Holy : Lord God of Sabaoth;<br>
    Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty : of thy glory.<br>
    The glorious company of the Apostles : praise thee.<br>
    The goodly fellowship of the Prophets : praise thee.<br>
    The noble army of Martyrs : praise thee.<br>
    The holy Church throughout all the world : doth acknowledge thee;<br>
    The Father : of an infinite Majesty;<br>
    Thine honourable, true : and only Son;<br>
    Also the Holy Ghost : the Comforter.<br>
    Thou art the King of Glory : O Christ.<br>
    Thou art the everlasting Son : of the Father.<br>
    When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man : thou didst not abhor the Virgin's womb.<br>
    When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death : thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.<br>
    Thou sittest at the right hand of God : in the glory of the Father.<br>
    We believe that thou shalt come : to be our Judge.<br>
    We therefore pray thee, help thy servants : whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.<br>
    Make them to be numbered with thy Saints : in glory everlasting.<br>
    O Lord, save thy people : and bless thine heritage.<br>
    Govern them : and lift them up for ever.<br>
    Day by day : we magnify thee;<br>
    And we worship thy Name : ever world without end.<br>
    Vouchsafe, O Lord : to keep us this day without sin.<br>
    O Lord, have mercy upon us : have mercy upon us.<br>
    O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us : as our trust is in thee.<br>
    O Lord, in thee have I trusted : let me never be confounded.</p>

    <p>O LORD, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by thy governance, to do always that is righteous in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
