    <h1>Evening Prayer</h1>
    
    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.</p>


    <p>MY soul doth magnify the Lord : and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.<br>
     For he hath regarded : the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>
     For behold, from henceforth : all generations shall call me blessed.<br>
     For he that is mighty hath magnified me : and holy is his Name.<br>
     And his mercy is on them that fear him : throughout all generations.<br>
     He hath showed strength with his arm : he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
     He hath put down the mighty from their seat : and hath exalted the humble and meek.<br>
     He hath filled the hungry with good things : and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br>
     He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel : as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, for ever.</p>
    
    <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.</p>

    <p>O LORD, show thy mercy upon us.<br>
 	  <b>And grant us thy salvation.</b><br>
 	  O Lord, save the State.<br>
 	  <b>And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.</b><br>
 	  Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.<br>
 	  <b>And make thy chosen people joyful.</b><br>
 	  O Lord, save thy people.<br>
 	  <b>And bless thine inheritance.</b><br>
 	  Give peace in our time, O Lord.<br>
 	  <b>For it is thou, Lord, only, that makest us dwell in safety.</b><br>
 	  O God, make clean our hearts within us.<br>
   	<b>And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.</b></p>

        <p>O GOD, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give; that both our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.</p>

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
