and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, *
and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
Thy gates shall be open continually; *
they shall not be shut day nor night.
And they shall call thee the City of the Lord, *
the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, *
wasting nor destruction in thy borders.
But thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, *
and thy gates Praise.
The sun shall be no more thy light by day, *
neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee,
But the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, *
and thy God thy glory.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
world without end. Amen.

Especially suitable for use during Lent
O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, *
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and of their righteous seed;
Who hast made heaven and earth, *
with all the ornament thereof;
Whom all men fear, *
and tremble before thy power;
But thy merciful promise *
is unmeasurable and unsearchable;
For thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion,
long-suffering, very merciful, *
and repentest of the evils of men.
Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness
hast promised repentance and forgiveness *
to them that have sinned against thee.
And of thine infinite mercies
hast appointed repentance unto sinners, *
that they may be saved.
Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, *
beseeching thee of grace.
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, *
and I acknowledge mine iniquities:
Wherefore I humbly beseech thee, forgive me,
O Lord, forgive me *
and destroy not with mine iniquities.
Be not angry with me forever, by reserving evil for me; *
neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth.
For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent; *
and in me thou wilt show all thy goodness:
For thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, *
according to thy great mercy.
Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: *
for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee,
And thine is the glory *
for ever and ever. Amen.

quaerite dominum
Especially suitable for use during Lent
Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, *
call ye upon him while he is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way, *
and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
And let him return unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him; *
and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *
neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than earth, *
so are my ways higher than your ways,
and my thoughts than your thoughts.
For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, *
and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth,
And maketh it bring forth and bud, *
that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: *
it shall not return unto me void,
But it shall accomplish that which I please, *
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
world without end. Amen. isaiah 55:6-11

He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; *

Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: *

The depths have covered them: *

Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: *
thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? *
who is like thee, glorious in holiness,
fearful in praises, doing wonders?
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, *
the earth swallowed them.
Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
redeemed: *
thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them *
in the mountain of thine inheritance,
In the place O Lord, which thou hast made
for thee to dwell in, *
in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
The Lord shall reign *
for ever and for ever.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
