                  the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have
                  everlasting life. <i>John 3:16</i></p>

                  This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,
                  That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. <i>1 Timothy 1:15</i></p>
                  <p>Hear also what Saint John saith.<BR />
                  If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
                  the righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our sins. <i>1 John 2:1-2</i></P>

                  <p>Therefore, O my Lord, because Thou didst come to save me a sinner, I desire with all my heart to repent of all my sin and to put away whatsoever displeases Thee. Grant me to grow in Thy grace that with all Thy blessed saints I may continually praise Thee. Amen.</p>
