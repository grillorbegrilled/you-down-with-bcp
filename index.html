                    And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br>
                    I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body, And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p>

                <p>Almighty and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle hast taught us to make prayers, and supplications, and to give thanks for all men; We humbly beseech thee most mercifully to receive these our prayers, which we offer unto thy Divine Majesty; beseeching thee to inspire continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity, and concord: And grant that all those who do confess thy holy Name may agree in the truth of thy holy Word, and live in unity and godly love.
                    We beseech thee also, so to direct and dispose the hearts of those who bear the authority of government in this and every land, especially <span name = "prez"></span> our President and <span name = "guv"></span> our Governor, that they may truly and impartially administer justice, to the punishment of wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion, and virtue.
                    Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops and other Ministers, especially <span name = "clergy"></span>, that they may, both by their life and doctrine, set forth thy true and lively Word, and rightly and duly administer thy holy Sacraments.
                    And to all thy People give thy heavenly grace, that, with meek heart and due reverence, they may hear, and receive thy holy Word; truly serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of their life.
                    And we most humbly beseech thee, of thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort and succour … all those who, in this transitory life, are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity.
                    And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy servants departed this life in thy faith and fear … ; beseeching thee to grant them continual growth in thy love and service, and to give us grace so to follow the good examples of … all thy saints, that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom.

                  Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I
                  will refresh you.<i>&mdash;Matthew 11:28</i><BR />
                  So God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, to
                  the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have
                  everlasting life.<i>&mdash;John 3:16</i></p>
                  <p>Hear also what Saint Paul saith.<BR />
                  This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,
                  That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.<i>&mdash;1 Timothy 1:15</i></p>
                  <p>Hear also what Saint John saith.<BR />
                  If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
                  the righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our sins.<i>&mdash;1 John 2:1-2</i></P>

                  <p class="devo">Therefore, O my Lord, because Thou didst come to save me a sinner, I desire with all my heart to repent of all my sin and to put away whatsoever displeases Thee. Grant me to grow in Thy grace that with all Thy blessed saints I may continually praise Thee. Amen.</p>
                
                  <P>Lift up your hearts.<BR />

                  Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.<BR />

                <p>We earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness, mercifully to
                  accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly
                  beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits and death of thy
                  Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we, and all
                  thy whole Church, may obtain remission of our sins, and all other
                  benefits of his passion. And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls
                  and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living sacrifice unto
                  thee; humbly beseeching thee that we may be filled
                  with thy grace and heavenly benediction, and made one body with
                  him, that he may dwell in us, and we in him. And although we
                  are unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any
                  sacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty
                  and service; not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences,
                  through Jesus Christ our Lord; by whom, and with whom, in the
                  unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O
                  Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.</p>
                
                <P>And now, as our Saviour Christ hath taught us, we are bold to say,</p>
                <p class="dropcap">OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
                    come. Thy will be done on earth, As it is in heaven. Give us
                    this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
                    forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
                    But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>

                <p class="devo">Grant, O Lord Jesus Christ, that as the hem of Thy garment, touched in faith, healed the woman who could not touch Thy Body, so the soul of Thy servant may be healed by like faith in Thee, Whom I cannot now sacramentally receive.
                I unite myself to Thee, and embrace Thee with all the affections of my soul. O let nothing ever separate me from Thee. Let me live and die in Thy love. Amen.</p>
                
                <p style="color: firebrick; font-size: 75%;">¶If a man, by any just impediment, do not receive the Sacrament of Christ’s Body and Blood,
                    if he do truly repent him of his sins, and stedfastly believe that Jesus Christ hath suffered death upon the Cross for him,
                    and shed his Blood for his redemption, earnestly remembering the benefits he hath thereby, and giving him hearty thanks therefor,
                    he doth eat and drink the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ profitably to his soul’s health, although he do not receive the Sacrament with his mouth.</p>

                <P>The Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given and shed for me, preserve my body and soul unto everlasting life.</P>

                <p class="devo">Lord Jesus, I thank Thee that Thou hast now fed me with Thy Body and Blood, and imparted to me Thy life. Teach me to live with a grateful heart, and as Thou hast to-day come anew into my soul, so abide in me continually, till in Thine own good time I may see Thee face to face, where Thou livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost one God world without end.

<h2>The Lord’s Day</h2>
<h3>For Sunday Morning.</h3>
<p>O GOD, who makest us glad with the weekly remembrance of the glorious resurrection of thy Son our Lord; Vouchsafe us this day such blessing through our worship of thee, that the days to come may be spent in thy service; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
<h3>Before receiving Holy Communion.</h3>
<p>WE do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy: Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his Body, and our souls washed through his most precious Blood, and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.</p>
<p>LORD, this is thy feast, prepared by thy longing, spread at thy command, attended at thine invitation, blessed by thine own word, distributed by thine own hand, the undying memorial of thy sacrifice upon the cross, the full gift of thine everlasting love, and its perpetuation till the end of time. Lord, this is the Bread of heaven, the Bread of life, that, whoso eateth, shall never hunger more. And this, the Cup of pardon, healing, gladness, strength, that, whoso drinketh, thirsteth not again. So may we come, O Lord, to thy table. Lord Jesus, come to us.</p>

    <h2>Personal Devotion</h2>
<h3>For the Spirit of Prayer.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, who pourest out on all who desire it the spirit of grace and of supplication; Deliver us, when we draw nigh to thee, from coldness of heart and wanderings of mind, that with stedfast thoughts and kindled affections, we may worship thee in spirit and in truth; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>In the Morning.</h3>
<p>O GOD, the King eternal, who dividest the day from the darkness, and turnest the shadow of death into the morning; Drive far off from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep thy law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; that having done thy will with cheerfulness while it was day, we may, when the night cometh, rejoice to give thee thanks; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, who alone gavest us the breath of life, and alone canst keep alive in us the holy desires thou dost impart; We beseech thee, for thy compassion’s sake, to sanctify all our thoughts and endeavours; that we may neither begin an action without a pure intention nor continue it without thy blessing. And grant that, having the eyes of the mind opened to behold things invisible and unseen, we may in heart be inspired by thy wisdom, and in work be upheld by thy strength, and in the end be accepted of thee as thy faithful servants; through Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.</p>

<h3>At Night.</h3>
<p>O LORD, support us all the day long, until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done. Then in thy mercy grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest, and peace at the last. Amen.</p>
<p>O GOD, who art the life of mortal men, the light of the faithful, the strength of those who labour, and the repose of the dead; We thank thee for the timely blessings of the day, and humbly supplicate thy merciful protection all this night.

<h3>For Faith, Hope, & Charity.</h3>
<p>O LORD God of infinite mercy, of infinite excellency, who hast sent thy holy Son into the world to redeem us from an intolerable misery, and to teach us a holy religion, and to forgive us an infinite debt: give me thy Holy Spirit, that my understanding and all my facilities may be so resigned to the discipline and doctrine of my Lord, that I may be prepared in mind and will to die for the testimony of Jesus, and to suffer any affliction or calamity that shall offer to hinder my duty, or tempt me to shame or sin or apostasy; and let my faith be the parent of a good life, a strong shield to repel the fiery darts of the devil, and the author of a holy hope, of modest desires, of confidence in God, and of a never-failing charity to thee, my God, and to all the world; that I may never have my portion with the unbelievers or uncharitable and desperate persons; but may be supported by the strengths of faith in all temptations, and may be refreshed with the comforts of a holy hope in all my sorrows, and may bear the burden of the Lord, and the infirmities of my neighbour, by the support of charity; that the yoke of Jesus may become easy to me, and my love may do all the miracles of grace, till from grace it swell to glory, from earth to heaven, from duty to reward, from the imperfections of a beginning and still growing love, it may arrive to the consummation of an eternal and never-ceasing charity, through Jesus Christ the Son of thy love, the author of our hope, and the author and finisher of our faith: to whom with thee, O Lord God, Father of heaven and earth, and with thy Holy Spirit, be all glory and love and obedience and dominion, now and for ever. Amen.

<h3>For Those We Love.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, we entrust all who are dear to us to thy never-failing care and love, [especially <i>N,</i>] for this life and the life to come; knowing that thou art doing for them better things than we can desire or pray for; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Those in Mental Suffering.</h3>

<h3>For Those in Bondage to Addiction.</h3>

<h3>For a Blessing on the Families of the Land.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, our heavenly Father, who settest the solitary in families; We commend to thy continual care the homes in which thy people dwell.

Knit together in constant affection those who, in holy wedlock, have been made one flesh; turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers; and so enkindle fervent charity among us all, that we be evermore kindly affectioned with brotherly love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For all Poor, Homeless, & Neglected Folk.</h3>
<p>O GOD, Almighty and merciful, who healest those that are broken in heart, and turnest the sadness of the sorrowful to joy; Let thy fatherly goodness be upon all that thou hast made. Remember in pity such as are this day destitute, homeless, or forgotten of their fellow-men. Bless the congregation of thy poor. Uplift those who are cast down. Mightily befriend innocent sufferers, and sanctify to them the endurance of their wrongs. Cheer with hope all discouraged and unhappy people, and by thy heavenly grace preserve from falling those whose penury tempteth them to sin; though they be troubled on every side, suffer them not to be distressed; though they be perplexed, save them from despair. Grant this, O Lord, for the love of him, who for our sakes became poor, thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

  <h3>For Prisoners.</h3>
<p>O GOD, who sparest when we deserve punishment, and in thy wrath rememberest mercy; We humbly beseech thee, of thy goodness, to comfort and succour all prisoners [especially those who are condemned to die]. Give them a right understanding of themselves, and of thy promises; that, trusting wholly in thy mercy, they may not place their confidence anywhere but in thee. Relieve the distressed, protect the innocent, awaken the guilty; and forasmuch as thou alone bringest light out of darkness, and good out of evil, grant to these thy servants, that by the power of thy Holy Spirit they may be set free from the chains of sin, and may be brought to newness of life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>A General Intercession.</h3>
<p>O GOD, at whose word man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the evening; Be merciful to all whose duties are difficult or burdensome, and comfort them concerning their toil. Shield from bodily accident and harm the workmen at their work. Protect the efforts of sober and honest industry, and suffer not the hire of the labourers to be kept back by fraud. Incline the heart of employers and of those whom they employ to mutual forbearance, fairness, and good-will. Give the spirit of governance and of a sound mind to all in places of authority. Bless all those who labour in works of mercy or in schools of good learning. Care for all aged persons, and all little children, the sick and the afflicted, and those who travel by land or by sea. Remember all who by reason of weakness are overtasked, or because of poverty are forgotten. Let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; and according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die. Give ear unto our prayer, O merciful and gracious Father, for the love of thy dear Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>O GOD, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only Saviour, the Prince of Peace; Give us grace seriously to lay to heart the great dangers we are in by our unhappy divisions. Take away all hatred and prejudice, and whatsoever else may hinder us from godly, union and concord: that as there is but one Body and one Spirit, and one hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of us all, so we may be all of one heart and of one soul, united in one holy bond of truth and peace, of faith and charity, and may with one mind and one mouth glorify thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Missions.</h3>
<p>O GOD, who hast made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the whole earth, and didst send thy blessed Son to preach peace to them that are far off and to them that are nigh; Grant that all men everywhere may seek after thee and find thee. Bring the nations into thy fold, pour out thy Spirit upon all flesh, and hasten thy kingdom; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. </p>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, whose compassions fail not, and whose loving-kindness reacheth unto the world’s end; We give thee humble thanks for opening heathen lands to the light of thy truth; for making paths in the deep waters and highways in the desert; and for planting thy Church in all the earth. Grant, we beseech thee, unto us thy servants, that with lively faith we may labour abundantly to make known to all men thy blessed gift of eternal life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For the Persecuted.</h3>
<p>O God, our refuge and strength, who art a very present help in trouble: Have mercy upon thy Church in the midst of oppression and persecution. Deliver thy people by thy mighty aid from tyranny and wrong; keep them faithful in the hour of trial; and restore to them the blessings of freedom and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

  <h2>Nature</h2>
<h3>For Rain.</h3>
<p>O GOD, heavenly Father, who by thy Son Jesus Christ hast promised to all those who seek thy kingdom, and the righteousness thereof, all things necessary to their bodily sustenance; Send us, we beseech thee, in this our necessity, such moderate rain and showers, that we may receive the fruits of the earth to our comfort, and to thy honour; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Fair Weather.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father, we humbly beseech thee, of thy great goodness, to restrain those immoderate rains, wherewith thou hast afflicted us. And we pray thee to send us such seasonable weather, that the earth may, in due time, yield her increase for our use and benefit; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Animals.</h3>
<p>O God, who hast made all the earth and every creature that dwelleth therein: Help us, we pray thee, to treat with compassion the living creatures entrusted to our care, that they may not suffer from our neglect nor become the victims of any cruelty; and grant that in caring for them we may find a deeper understanding of thy love for all creation; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h2>Hard Times</h2>
<h3>In Time of Dearth and Famine.</h3>
<p>O GOD, heavenly Father, whose gift it is that the rain doth fall, and the earth bring forth her increase; Behold, we beseech thee, the afflictions of thy people; increase the fruits of the earth by thy heavenly benediction; and grant that the scarcity and dearth, which we now most justly suffer for our sins, may, through thy goodness, be mercifully turned into plenty; for the love of Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>In Time of War.</h3>
        <p>O GOD, who hast taught us in thy holy Word that thou dost not willingly afflict the children of men: Grant that in the present time of warfare and distress of nations our people may know thy presence and obey thy will. Remove from us arrogance and feebleness; give us courage and loyalty, tranquility and self-control, that we may accomplish that which thou givest us to do, and endure that which thou givest us to bear; for his sake who was lifted up on the cross to draw all men unto him, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Victims of War.</h3>
<p>O GOD, who hast promised that they that wait upon thee shall renew their strength: We commend to thee all who suffer in this time of war; the wounded, the sick, and the prisoners; the homeless, the hungry, and the oppressed; the anxious, the frightened, and the bereaved. Strengthen them, O Lord, with thy Holy Spirit, and give them friends to help them; we ask it in his name, who bore for us the agony of the cross, thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<h3>In Time of Calamity.</h3>
<p>O GOD, merciful and compassionate, who art ever ready to hear the prayers of those who put their trust in thee; Graciously hearken to us who call upon thee, and grant us thy help in this our need; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>In Time of Great Sickness and Mortality.</h3>
<p>O MOST mighty and merciful God, in this time of grievous sickness, we flee unto thee for succour. Deliver us, we beseech thee, from our peril; give strength and skill to all those who minister to the sick; prosper the means made use of for their cure; and grant that, perceiving how frail and uncertain our life is, we may apply our hearts unto that heavenly wisdom which leadeth to eternal life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Christian Service.</h3>
<p>O LORD our heavenly Father, whose blessed Son came not to be ministered unto, but to minister; We beseech thee to bless all who, following in his steps, give themselves to the service of their fellow men. Endue them with wisdom, patience, and courage, that they may strengthen the weak and raise up those who fall; and, being inspired by thy love, may worthily minister in thy Name to the suffering, the friendless, and the needy; for the sake of him who laid down his life for us, the same thy Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Social Justice.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, who hast created man in thine own image; Grant us grace fearlessly to contend against evil, and to make no peace with oppression; and, that we may reverently use our freedom, help us to employ it in the maintenance of justice among men and nations, to the glory of thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For the Employed.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, our heavenly Father, who declarest thy glory and showest forth thy handiwork in the heavens and in the earth; Deliver us, we beseech thee, in our several callings, from the service of mammon, that we may do the work which thou givest us to do, in truth, in beauty, and in righteousness, with singleness of heart as thy servants, and to the benefit of our fellow men; for the sake of him who came among us as one that serveth, thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For Cities, Towns, and Villages.</h3>
<p>O GOD, whose Son was content to share the life of his village at Nazareth: Bless, we beseech thee, the life of this city with thy continual presence. Grant that in every family thy name may be hallowed, and thy will be done; that our children may learn to love the faith of Jesus Christ, and that men and women may be good neighbours and live godly lives; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>O GOD, our Father, whose will is our peace: Strengthen and sustain the common life of this community. Forgive our sins and negligences; exalt our purposes: purify our aims; free us from selfish desires; and make us of one heart and mind in thy service, for the glory of thy name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>For the Family of Nations.</h3>

<h3>For Racial Cooperation.</h3>
<p>O GOD, who hast made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the face of the earth, and who by thy Son Jesus Christ hast broken down the wall of partition between the races of men: Break down, we beseech thee, all that divides us one from another. Shame our jealousies and lay low our pride; do away all prejudice, that the bonds of fellowship and mutual service may unite all peoples, and we may live in peace together, to the glory of thy great name; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>In Prosperous Times.</h3>
<p>O GOD, who in thy love hast bestowed upon us gifts such as our fathers never knew or dreamed of: Mercifully grant that we be not so occupied with material things that we forget the things which are spiritual; lest, having gained the whole world, we lose our own soul; for thy mercy’s sake. Amen.</p>

Amen.</p>

<h3>For Travellers by Road.</h3>
<p>ALMIGHTY God, who dost sanctify with thy Spirit the common ways of life: Give to us and to all who use the roads the spirit of courtesy and goodwill, of carefulness and self-control; that by our thought for others we may all be preserved from needless danger and sudden death, and may live to glorify thee in our going out and our coming in; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
