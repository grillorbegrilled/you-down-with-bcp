                <p>I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: <br>
                    And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br>
                    I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body, And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p>
                <hr>
                <P>Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church.<BR />
                  ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle hast taught
                  us to make prayers, and supplications, and to give thanks for
                  all men; We humbly beseech thee most mercifully to receive these our prayers, which
                  we offer unto thy Divine Majesty; beseeching thee to inspire
                  continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity,
                  and concord: And grant that all those who do confess thy holy
                  Name may agree in the truth of thy holy Word, and live in unity
                  and godly love.</p>
                  <p>We beseech thee also, so to direct
                  and dispose the hearts of all Christian Rulers, that they may
                  truly and impartially administer justice, to the punishment of
                  wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion,
                  and virtue.</p>
                  <p>Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops and other Ministers,
                  that they may, both by their life and doctrine, set forth thy
                  true and lively Word, and rightly and duly administer thy holy
                  Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>And to all thy People give thy heavenly grace; that, with meek heart and
                  due reverence, they may hear, and receive thy holy Word; truly
                  serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of their
                  life.</p>
                  <p>And we most humbly beseech thee, of thy goodness, O Lord, to
                  comfort and succour all those who, in this transitory life, are
                  in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity.</p>
                  <p>And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy servants departed
                  this life in thy faith and fear; beseeching thee to grant them
                  continual growth in thy love and service, and to give us grace
                  so to follow their good examples, that with them we may be partakers
                  of thy heavenly kingdom. Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's
                  sake, our only Mediator and Advocate. Amen.</P>
                <P>ALMIGHTY God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,
                  Judge of all men; We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins
                  and wickedness, Which we, from time to time, most grievously
                  have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against thy Divine
                  Majesty, Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against
                  us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these
                  our misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The
                  burden of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, Have mercy
                  upon us, most merciful Father; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's
                  sake, Forgive us all that is past; And grant that we may ever
                  hereafter Serve and please thee In newness of life, To the honour
                  and glory of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>
                  
                  <P>Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith unto all
                  who truly turn to him.<BR />
                  COME unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I
                  will refresh you. <i>Matthew 11:28</i><BR />
                  So God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, to
                  the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have
                  everlasting life. <i>John 3:16</i></p>
                  <p>Hear also what Saint Paul saith.<BR />
                  This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,
                  That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. <i>1 Timothy 1:15</i></p>
                  <p>Hear also what Saint John saith.<BR />
                  If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
                  the righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our sins. <i>1 John 2:1-2</i></P>
                  
                  <P>Lift up your hearts.<BR />
                  <b>We lift them up unto the Lord.</b><BR />
                  Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.<BR />
                  <b>It is meet and right so to do.</b></P>
