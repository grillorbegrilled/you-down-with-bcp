<h2>THE INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>DEARLY beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in Holy Matrimony; which is an honourable estate instituted of God himself, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church; which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought, in Cana of Galilee, and is commended in Holy Writ to be honourable among all men; and therefore is not by any to be enterprised, nor taken in hand, unadvisedly lightly or wantonly; but reverently, discreetly, soberly, and in the fear of God, duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained.</p>
<p>First, It was ordained for the increase of mankind according to the will of God, and that children might be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise of his holy name.<br>
Secondly, It was ordained in order that the natural instincts and affections, implanted by God, should be hallowed and directed aright; that those who are not called of God to remain unmarried, but by him are led to this holy estate, should continue therein in pureness of living.<br>
Thirdly, It was ordained for the mutual society, help, and comfort, that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity.</p>
<!--<p>Into which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined. Therefore if any man can shew any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.</p>

I REQUIRE and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it. For be ye well assured, that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s word doth allow are not joined together by God ; neither is their matrimony lawful.

<h2>THE MARRIAGE.</h2>
N. WILT thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together according to God’s law in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health? and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live ?

The man shall answer, I will.

Then shall the Priest say unto the woman,

N. WILT thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together according to God’s law in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honour and keep him, in sick ness and in health? and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?

The woman shall answer, I will.

Then shall the Priest say,

Who giveth this woman to be married to this man ?
 
I, N. take thee, N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; in sickness and in health; to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God’s holy law; and thereto I give thee my troth.

Then shall they loose their hands; and the woman, with her right hand taking the man by his right hand, shall likewise say after the Priest,

I, N. take thee, N. to my wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; in sickness and in health; to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God’s holy law; and thereto I give thee my troth.

WITH this ring I thee wed; with my body I thee honour; and all my worldly goods with thee share ; In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

Let us pray.

O ETERNAL God, creator and preserver of all mankind, giver of all spiritual grace, the author of everlasting life; send thy blessing upon these thy servants, this man and this woman, whom we bless in thy name; that, living faithfully together, they may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made, whereof this ring given and received is a token and pledge; and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together, and live according to thy laws; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

<h2>The Proclamation</h2>
Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.

FORASMUCH as N. and N. have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring, and by joining of hands; I pronounce that they be man and wife together, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

<h2>THE BENEDICTION.</h2>
GOD the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you; and so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye may so live together in this life, that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen.

<h2>Psalm 128</h2>
<p>BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord : and walk in his ways.<br>
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : O well is thee, and happy shalt thou be.<br>
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine upon the walls of thine house;<br>
Thy children like the olive-branches round about thy table.<br>
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed : that feareth the Lord.<br>
The Lord from out of Zion shall so bless thee : that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;<br>
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children’s children and peace upon Israel.</p>

<!--1662: <h2>Psalm 128</h2>-->

<h2>Psalm 67</h2>
<p>GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us : and shew us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us.<br>
That thy way may be known upon earth : thy saving health among all nations.<br>
Let the people praise thee, O God : yea, let all the people praise thee.<br>
O let the nations rejoice and be glad : for thou shalt judge the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.<br>
Let the people praise thee, O God : yea, let all the people praise thee.<br>
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase : and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.<br>
God shall bless us : and all the ends of the world shall fear him.</p>

<h2>Psalm 37:3-7</h2>
<p>PUT thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good : dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<br>
Delight thou in the Lord : and he shall give thee thy heart’s desire.<br>
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him : and he shall bring it to pass.<br>
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light : and thy just dealing as the noon-day.<br>
Hold thee still in the Lord: and abide patiently upon him.</p>

<p>Glory be.</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>
<b>Christ, have mercy upon us.</b><br>
Lord, have mercy upon us.</p>

<p>OUR Father.</p>

<p>O Lord, save thy servant, and thy handmaid;<br>
<b>Who put their trust in thee.</b><br>
O Lord, send them help from thy holy place<br>
<b>And evermore defend them.</b><br>
Be unto them a tower of strength;<br>
<b>From the face of their enemy.</b><br>
O Lord, hear our prayer;<br>
<b>And let our cry come unto thee.</b></p>

<p>O GOD of our fathers, bless these thy servants, and sow the seed of eternal life in their hearts; that whatsoever in thy holy Word they shall profitably learn, they may in deed fulfil the same; that so, obeying thy will, and alway being in safety under thy protection, they may abide in thy love unto their lives’ end; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>O GOD, who hast taught us that it should never be lawful to put asunder those whom thou by Matrimony hast made one, and hast consecrated the state of matrimony to such an excellent mystery, that in it is signified and represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and his Church; Look mercifully upon these thy servants, that both this man may love his wife, according to thy Word, (as Christ did love his spouse the Church, who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it even as his own flesh,) and also that this woman may be loving and amiable, and faithful to her husband, and in all quietness, sobriety, and peace, be a follower of holy and godly matrons. O Lord, bless them both, and grant them to inherit thy everlasting kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>ALMIGHTY God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Pour upon you the riches of his grace, sanctify and bless you, that ye may please him both in body and soul, and live together in holy love unto your lives’ end. Amen.</p>

<p>O ALMIGHTY Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>THE grace.</p>
