    <p>OUR Father.</p>
    <h3>For Missions.</h3>
    <p>Almighty God our Savior, who desirest that none should perish,
    and hast taught us through thy Son that there is great joy in
    heaven over every sinner who repents: Grant that our hearts
    may grieve this lost and broken world and may thy Holy Spirit
    work through our words, deeds, and prayers, that the lost may
    be found and the dead made quick, and that all thy redeemed
    may rejoice around thy throne; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
    Amen.</p>
