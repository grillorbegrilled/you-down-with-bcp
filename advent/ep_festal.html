    <h1>Evening Prayer</h1>
    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>
    <i>And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.</i><br>
    O God, make speed to save us.<br>
    <i>O Lord, make haste to help us.</i><br>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    <i>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</i><br>
    Praise ye the Lord.<br>
    <i>The Lord's Name be praised.</i></p>
    
    <p>GLORY be to God on high, and in earth peace, good will towards men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.<br>
    O Lord, the only begotten Son Jesu Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon us.<br>
    For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>

    <p>O LORD, show thy mercy upon us.<br>
 	  <i>And grant us thy salvation.</i><br>
 	  O Lord, save the State.<br>
 	  <i>And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.</i><br>
 	  Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.<br>
 	  <i>And make thy chosen people joyful.</i><br>
 	  O Lord, save thy people.<br>
 	  <i>And bless thine inheritance.</i><br>
 	  Give peace in our time, O Lord.<br>
 	  <i>For it is thou, Lord, only, that makest us dwell in safety.</i><br>
 	  O God, make clean our hearts within us.<br>
   	<i>And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.</i></p>

    <p>ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which thy Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, now and for ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>O GOD, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give; that both our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.</p>

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
