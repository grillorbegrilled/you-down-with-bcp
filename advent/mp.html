    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>BLESSED be the Lord God of Israel : for he hath visited and redeemed his people;<br>
    And hath raised up a mighty salvation for us : in the house of his servant David;<br>
    As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets : which have been since the world began;<br>
    That we should be saved from our enemies : and from the hand of all that hate us.<br>
    To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers : and to remember his holy Covenant;<br>
    To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham : that he would give us;<br>
    That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies : might serve him without fear;<br>
    In holiness and righteousness before him : all the days of our life.<br>
    And thou, Child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;<br>
    To give knowledge of salvation unto his people : for the remission of their sins,<br>
    Through the tender mercy of our God : whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us;<br>
    To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death : and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
    
    <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;<br>
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.</p>

    <p>I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth : <br>
    And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br>
    I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholick Church; The Communion of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body, And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p>

    <p>O LORD, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by thy governance, to do always that is righteous in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
